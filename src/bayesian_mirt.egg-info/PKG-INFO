# Bayesian MIRT

This package is for the Bayesian MIRT model. Currently under development.


# Installation

While developing:

```python
pip install -e .
```


# Usage

```python
import bayesian_mirt as bmirt
```

# Inference

We recommend working in a virtual environment for package development. Use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to 
automatically activate your virtual environment.

```bash
# set up virtual environment, install required packages, and install bayesian_mirt
python -m pip install --upgrade pip virtualenv
python -m virtualenv --prompt="(bmirt) " .venv

# use direnv to activate the virtual environment whenever you are in the working directory
echo "source .venv/bin.activate > .envrc"
direnv allow

# install packages into new (activated) virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

All tests should be completed within the virtual environment, to ensure consistency. We test with tox, so any version of
Python3.6+ should work fine.


### Tetsing 

After making changes, apply the package formatting rules and check that the package still passes the tests. This is 
achieved easily with the help of our Makefile.

```bash
make help  # check allowable make commands for more information
make format
make test
tox  # check that package passes tests on all tox versions
```

That's it! We would love your contributions or suggestions.
